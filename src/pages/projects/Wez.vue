        Grimacing, menacing; ruthless henchman in service of the Humungus, stormy petrel of the post-apocalyptic wasteland. This mighty thicc boi glowers like a wrestler, fuming across the squared circle at the Intercontinental Dystopia World Champion gold title belt holder he aims to defeat: his enemy, to be vanquished. Failure is not an option, and even the concept has never entered Wez's mind. Wez is here to chew gum and fornicate righteously; in the absense of these two primary options, kicking ass is his fall-back position.

        <p>What Would Wez Do? He'd chase you across the veldt, an unrelenting pursuit to separate you from your milk money. And when he caught up - and, rest assured, he WILL catch up - one stout hip check will loosen both your molars and your coin purse.</p>

        <p>Wez: hewn from mighty black locust, dense and heavy like a bowling ball; brindle, like the most regal Great Dane. Fits as lovingly in the palm as a cupped cheek (oooh you nasty not that).</p>
        <p>Wood salvaged from a downed tree in Doraville, Georgia.</p>
